# L.A.-Crime-Analysis  
My goal is to analyze Los Angelesâ€™ crime dataset to determine patterns in communities that are most affected by crime and to provide our findings to police officials for crime prevention. I plan to study variables such as: history of crime in specific locations, age of individuals most and least likely to be affect by crime and crime types. Additionally, I would like to analyze the frequency of crime types to determine if there are specific times or areas in which they occur.  
  
  
Summary:  

I utilized the Los Angeles (LA) crime dataset provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to examine the history of crimes that occurred in Los Angeles between 2020 to the present date.  

Regarding the crime type, I found that 'Battery: Simple Assault' was the most frequent crime to occur, specifically accounting for 22% of the total crime types. Additionally, I observed that more serious (violent) crimes tend to occur more frequently during the summer than other seasons (winter, spring and autumn). Specifically, serious crimes include: rape, sexual assault, robbery and serious injuries.   

In terms of higher crime risk areas in LA, I focused on one crime type for my analysis: battery. I conducted a cluster analysis and determined that the majority of battery crimes were concentrated in the downtown area, which can be easily seen from the plugins map in our report (Section 3.4).   

An analysis of the victim's demographics demonstrate that most victims were between the ages of 20-40 years old, with the average age being 35 years old. I also found that there were 8,968 victims who were of age 0 (children). The top 5 crimes involving children of age 0 include: robbery, burglary, vandalism, discharge firearms & assualt with a deadly weapon.  

Lastly, another interesting pattern I observed was that domestic violence was the main type of crime for both child victims and female victims, with their percentages being 30 and 24, respectively.   

My recommendations to the LAPD would be to increase budget and public awareness about crimes during the summer months during high crime times (between 6 pm to 12 AM) when crime rates are seen to increase. Additionally, providing support in areas where crimes are more frequent would help increase safety within these neighborhoods.
